    <h2>Developing your pieces in the Opening</h2>
    <p>When you start a game, the most important thing is to Develop your Pieces wihout delay.
        Fully developed means having your knights and bishops on active squares, and castled (or ready to castle).</p>
    <p>Bishops and knights are the <em>minor pieces</em>. Bring them out first.  Don't move a piece twice in the opening.</p>
    <p>When your bishops and knights are on active squares, plan which side you will castle, and when.</p>
