    <h4>The Center squares</h4>
    <p>The four central squares are called The Center, and control of the center is key.</p>
    <p>If you can put two pawns on the cental squares, do so.  Then defend them against attack.
        If you can, advance the center.</p>
    <p>If your opponent has a pawn center, attack it. Don't let it advance.</p>
